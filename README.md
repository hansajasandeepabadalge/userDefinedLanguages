# Notepad++ User Defined Languages (UDLs) Collection

This repository contains a curated collection of **User Defined Languages (UDLs)** for [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), offering custom syntax highlighting and styling for multiple programming and scripting languages.

## 📚 Supported Languages

- TypeScript

Each UDL is designed to enhance the developer experience with:
- Custom keyword groups and comment handling
- Syntax-aware styling
- Dark theme-compatible colors and fonts

## 📥 Installation

1. Open **Notepad++**.
2. Go to **Language > User Defined Language > Define your language**.
3. Click **Import...** and choose the `.xml` file for the language you want to install.
4. The language will appear in the **Language** menu using the name defined in its XML.

Repeat the above steps for each UDL you'd like to add.

## 🖌️ Theme Compatibility

All UDLs are optimized for a **dark background** (`#272822`) to reduce eye strain and improve visual clarity.

You can further customize:
- Font styles (bold, italic)
- Color themes
- Keyword groups
- Comment formats

> Each `.xml` file corresponds to one UDL definition.

## 🧩 Customization Tips

- Use **Define your language...** in Notepad++ to tweak styles.
- Add or remove keywords to better match your coding conventions.
- Export your custom UDLs for backup or sharing.
